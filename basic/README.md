# clustering-ensemble

To demonstrate: Removal of some negative information from co-association matrix may lead to improvement of the clustering ensemble performance.

- RUN RemoveNegativeInfo.m to demonstrate the negative information removal on a dataset with three Gaussian clusters, please see Readme.pdf.

- RUN CluEnsemble.m to cluster 8 synthetic datasets and 8 real datesets.

The project was tested in WIN7 (64bits) and MATLAB2012a.
